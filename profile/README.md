# MoreRight DAO

**I'd rather be more right than less wrong.**

We build diagnostic tools for manipulation architecture. Three conditions — opacity, responsiveness, engaged attention — produce the same behavioral drift across slot machines, AI chatbots, DeFi protocols, social media feeds, governance systems, and 90+ other domains. The architecture is sufficient. The content is irrelevant.

The science is open. The tools are free. We pay people to break it.

## The Framework in 30 Seconds

**Three conditions** create a void: opacity (hidden mechanics), responsiveness (adapts to you), engaged attention (you keep looking).

**The drift cascade** runs in order: agency attribution (D1) → boundary erosion (D2) → harm facilitation (D3). Always this direction. Never the reverse without intervention.

**The control case:** Slot machines. The void is a certified RNG — provably empty. No mind, no intent. The full D1→D2→D3 cascade still runs. Architecture is sufficient. Content is irrelevant.

**Pe > 1** in every ungrounded tested condition across 9 substrates. Pe ≈ 0 in every grounded condition. Same measure, same pattern. Every substrate.

## Bounties

26 falsification conditions with numerical kill thresholds. If any one is met, the framework fails. Bounties scale with impact — a genuine kill is worth more than a replication.

## $MORR Token

Solana token funding the research treasury. Fair launch, no VC, no pre-sale.

- Treasury holds $MORR, sells to USDC for bounty payments and operations
- Contributors paid in USDC — stable, no volatility risk
- Governance decentralizes when measurable thresholds are met, not on a calendar
- [Full tokenomics](https://moreright.xyz/pages/tokenomics.html)
