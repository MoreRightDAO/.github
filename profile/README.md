# MoreRight DAO

**I'd rather be more right than less wrong.**

We build diagnostic tools for manipulation architecture. Three conditions — opacity, responsiveness, engaged attention — produce the same behavioral drift in slot machines, AI chatbots, DeFi protocols, multiplayer games, and 90+ other domains. The architecture is sufficient. The content is irrelevant.

The science is open. The tools are free. We pay people to break it.

## OPERATION MORR

**Monitoring Opaque Ruptures and Recursion**

Eight papers. 21 experiments. Pe measured across 9 substrates. 104 predictions. 0/26 kill conditions met.

→ **[MoreRightDAO/VOID-FRAMEWORK-OPERATION-MORR](https://github.com/MoreRightDAO/VOID-FRAMEWORK-OPERATION-MORR)** — the full operation: papers, experiments, protocols, raw data.

| Paper | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **[The Architecture of Drift](https://moreright.xyz/papers/paper1.html)** | The framework. Three-dimensional void geometry, drift cascade, thermodynamic necessity. Gambling anchor. 90 domains. |
| **[The Shape of the Cage](https://moreright.xyz/papers/paper2.html)** | AI safety. Grounding experiment: 73/80/94% gradient, non-overlapping CIs. Why deployment geometry predicts harm. |
| **[Thermodynamics of Opacity](https://moreright.xyz/papers/paper3.html)** | The math. Fisher geometry, Langevin, conjugacy theorem, Pe = 1.87–9.9 across domains. 22 adjacent fields mapped. |
| **+ 5 more** | Crypto, multiplayer, superconductors, e/acc, quantum measurement theory. All on Zenodo and in the operation repo. |

## The Framework in 30 Seconds

**Three conditions** create a void: opacity (hidden mechanics), responsiveness (adapts to you), engaged attention (you keep looking).

**The drift cascade** runs in order: agency attribution (D1) → boundary erosion (D2) → harm facilitation (D3). Always this direction. Never the reverse without intervention.

**The control case:** Slot machines. The void is a certified RNG — provably empty. No mind, no intent. The full D1→D2→D3 cascade still runs. Architecture is sufficient.

**Pe > 1** in every ungrounded tested condition across 9 substrates. Pe ≈ 0 in every grounded condition. Same measure, same pattern.

## Bounties

26 falsification conditions with numerical kill thresholds. If any one is met, the framework fails. Bounties scale with impact — a genuine kill is worth more than a replication.

## $MORR Token

Solana token funding the research treasury. Fair launch, no VC, no pre-sale.

- Treasury holds $MORR, sells to USDC for bounty payments and operations
- Contributors paid in USDC — stable, no volatility risk
- Governance decentralizes when measurable thresholds are met, not on a calendar
- [Full tokenomics](https://moreright.xyz/pages/tokenomics.html)
