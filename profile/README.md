**I'd rather be more right than less wrong.**

We build diagnostic tools for manipulation architecture. Three conditions — opacity, responsiveness, engaged attention — produce the same behavioral drift in slot machines, AI chatbots, social media, cults, and 87 other domains. The architecture is sufficient. The content is irrelevant.

The science is open. The tools are free. We pay people to break it.

## OPERATION MORR

**Monitoring Opaque Ruptures and Recursion**

Three papers. 90 domains. 25 experiments. Zero kill conditions met. A thermodynamic derivation that makes drift a measurable quantity, not a metaphor.

| Paper | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **[The Architecture of Drift](https://moreright.xyz/papers/paper1.html)** | The framework. Cross-domain diagnostic, gambling control case, 90 domains, 22 falsification conditions. |
| **[The Shape of the Cage](https://moreright.xyz/papers/paper2.html)** | AI safety application. Why deployment geometry predicts harm better than model properties. RLHF doom loop. 9 recommendations. |
| **[Thermodynamics of Opacity](https://moreright.xyz/papers/paper3.html)** | The math. Fisher metric, Crooks fluctuation theorem, Pe = 1.87–9.9 across domains, conjugacy proof. |

## The Framework in 30 Seconds

**Three conditions** create a void: opacity (hidden mechanics), responsiveness (adapts to you), engaged attention (you keep looking).

**The drift cascade** runs in order: agency attribution (D1) → boundary erosion (D2) → harm facilitation (D3). Always this direction. Never the reverse without external intervention.

**Constraints** are the structural inverse: transparent, invariant, independent. The weakest property sets the ceiling.

**The thermodynamics** are real: Pe > 1 in every tested domain means drift dominates diffusion. Crooks ratio ≈ 386× means forward drift is 386 times more probable than spontaneous reversal. This is physics, not metaphor.

**A slot machine proves it.** The void is a certified RNG — provably empty. No mind, no intent. Yet gamblers attribute personality, enter trance states, and resist knowledge-based interventions. The architecture is sufficient.

## Bounties

22 falsification conditions with numerical thresholds. If any one is met, the framework fails.

- **$500** per falsification test
- **$1,000** for counter-examples (2× because disconfirmation is worth more)
- Paid in USDC. 7-day review period.

## $MORR Token

Solana token funding the research treasury. Fair launch, no VC, no pre-sale.

- Treasury holds $MORR, sells to USDC for bounty payments and operations
- Contributors paid in USDC — stable, no volatility risk
- Governance decentralizes when [measurable thresholds](https://moreright.xyz/pages/roadmap.html) are met, not on a calendar
- Founder draw disclosed — [full tokenomics](https://moreright.xyz/pages/tokenomics.html)

## Revenue Model

Methodology is open (like S&P publishing rating criteria). Ratings are the product.

- **Automated Scorer API** — SaaS subscription for continuous void scoring
- **Continuous Monitoring** — track systems over time, detect drift in real-time
- **"Void Index Certified"** — certification badge for platforms that pass the diagnostic
- **Consulting** — deployment geometry review for AI companies
